title: "Wait a second.. But what \"Information\" really is?"
date: 2024-11-22

My intuition

- ether of communication?
- valuable piece 
- interesting patterns
	- two opposites: complete blankness and complete randomness
- connection to state of the world
- my take: it's subjective (relativity?)

Definitions

- Dictionaries
- Information theory - book or course or something
- Wikipedia
